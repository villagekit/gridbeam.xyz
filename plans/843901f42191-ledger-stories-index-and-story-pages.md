The parity ledger holds every difference on the stories index and the six story pages, cited on both sides and judged by rule, with copy and `added` items left `open` for the operator. Sliced from M1 (`c6182c6a`); decisions `ee86d68a`, `2032533f`, `ad5363e4`, `ca677697`, `bfa9a416`.

## Work

Run the `parity` skill on: `/stories`, `/stories/whats-a-grid-unit`, `/stories/how-to-cut-grid-beams`, `/stories/how-to-furniture-bolts`, `/stories/building-with-grid-kit`, `/stories/2021-winter-newsletter`, `/stories/2022-newsletter`. Capture first (`pnpm audit:pages` and `pnpm audit:dom` with a routes file listing exactly these routes, each carrying its side marker from `scripts/audit-routes.txt`, against the live legacy site and a local `pnpm dev`), then one Sonnet sub-agent per route per family (copy, visual and interaction, accessibility, code), then mint and judge every difference. The MDX prose was verified word-for-word faithful in August 2026 (note `48c33db3`); diff it anyway, mechanically, and expect few copy items beyond the rebrand rule, the editorial note device and the heading levels named in note `526d5330`; the legacy `story-image-carousel` on the two newsletters is that note's `ImageCarousel` finding on those two routes.
Interfaces: the `difference` items, by route, for the route records under M2 (`337e35d8`).
Verify first: `audit/<slug>/dom/` exists for each route (the tooling slice `4465f31e` shipped) and the shell ledger (`b2ed8f4c`) is filed.
Not this slice: fixing anything; judging copy.

## Seams under test

None pure.

## Done when

- For each of these routes, `kipu list --collection difference --filter route=<route> --json` has items, or the note below records that the sub-agents found the route identical on every family
- Every `open` item among them is on the `copy` axis or has `kind: added`
- Every `sanctioned` item's Verdict names a rule or a lock
- A `kipu note` on M1 (`c6182c6a`) records the counts per state, axis and kind for these routes and what the sub-agents found identical
- `kipu verify` is green
- `pnpm check` is green
